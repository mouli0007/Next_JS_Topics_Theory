### App Directory ### All components are server somponents not client components

1=> We can create an app directory and make it as an main Index page rather than using index.js in pages folder
2=> It will create an automatic layout section which we can avoid creating with manual components 
3=> and we can make file routing same as we does in pages directory
4=> In the Link Component we dont need to use a tag to work on different scenarios

5=> Since its a server components we can make it as async even in high level component

6=> For dynamic pages we have to create a dynamic folder with a square bracket and we have to add a page.js file 
    so that file will act as a dynamic page
